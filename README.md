This repository contains some challenges written for the OpenCTF competition, hosted at DEFCON.

- Absence: Polyglot source code challenge.
- Solenya: Python web challenge.
- Waldo's Retort: Network and privilege escalation challenge.
- PC Load Letter: Network and privilege escalation challenge.
- Rosetta Stone: Obfuscation challenge containing three interlocking puzzles:
  1. Upper: Programmable logic array (PLA) circuit diagrams.
  2. Middle: x86 ASM.
  3. Lower: COBOL.

Some of the documentation could be better, particularly for Rosetta Stone.
